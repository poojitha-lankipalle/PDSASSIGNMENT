Frailty Data-

Aim:
Analysing the weakness on various factors.

Abstract:
This dataset consists of fragility information related to many topics.
Understanding how height, weight, age, and grip strengthÂ impact the frailty is the aim.
We will seek to look at each variable and their associations with the goal of generating a detailed
statistical analysis of the data using both R scripts
and visualizations.


Data Set Characteristics:
There are 10 observations on 5 different variables in all.
